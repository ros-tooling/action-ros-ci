# `action-ros-ci`

[![GitHub Action Status](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci/workflows/Test%20action-ros-ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This action builds a [ROS, or ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros/) workspace from source, and run colon-test on the package under test.

## Requirements

This action requires ROS development tools (`colcon`, `rosdep`, `vcs`) to be installed on the CI worker instance.

On Linux, the setup can be done through [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros), or by running the action in a Docker image containing the appropriate binaries.

## Overview

The action first assembles a workspace, then run `colcon build`, and `colcon test` in it.

The workspace is built by running:
* `vcs import` on the repo file specified through the `vcs-repo-file-url` argument (defaults to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/master/ros2.repos`).
* checkout the code under test in the workspace using `vcs`
* run `colcon build` for all packages specified in `package-name`
* run `colcon test` for all packages specified in `package-name`

## Action Output

This action defines [an output variable](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs) `ros-workspace-directory-name`.
It contains the path to the root of the ROS workspace assembled by the action.

The variable value should be used to retrieve logs, binaries, etc. after the action completes.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml) to get the list of flags supported by this action.

[action-ros-ci-template](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci-template) offers a template for using `action-ros-ci`

### Build and run `ament_copyright` tests

```yaml
steps:
- uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@0.0.15
- uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@0.0.14
  with:
    package-name: ament_copyright
```

### Build with a custom `repos` or `rosinstall` file

You can specify your own repos file using the `vcs-repo-file-url` input.
You can also automatically generate your package's dependencies using the following workflow:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@0.0.15
# Run the generator and output the results to a file.
- run: |
    rosinstall_generator <package-name> --rosdistro <target-distro> \
    --deps-only --deps --upstream-development > /tmp/deps.repos
# Pass the file to the action
- uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@0.0.14
  with:
    package-name: my_package
    vcs-repo-file-url: /tmp/deps.repos
```
