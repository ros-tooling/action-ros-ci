# `action-ros-ci`

[![GitHub Action Status](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci/workflows/Test%20action-ros-ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci)
[![Dependabot Status](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/status?host=github&repo=ros-tooling/action-ros-ci)](https://dependabot.com)

This action builds and tests a [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/), or [ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/) workspace from source.

## Developing

For developing and releasing `action-ros-ci`, see DEVELOPING.md

## Requirements

This action requires the following ROS development tools to be installed (and initialized if applicable) on the CI worker instance:

```
curl
colcon-common-extensions
colcon-lcov-result  # Optional
colcon-coveragepy-result
colcon-mixin
rosdep
vcstool
```

On Linux, the setup can be done through [`ros-tooling/setup-ros`](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros), or by running the action in a Docker image containing the appropriate binaries.

## Overview

The action first assembles a workspace, then runs `colcon build`, and `colcon test` in it.

The workspace is built by running:

- `vcs import` on the repo file specified through the `vcs-repo-file-url` argument (defaults to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/master/ros2.repos`).
- checkout the code under test in the workspace using `vcs`
- `rosdep install` for the workspace, to get its dependencies
- run `colcon build` for all packages specified in `package-name`
- run `colcon test` for all packages specified in `package-name`

This action requires targeting a ROS or ROS 2 distribution explicitly.
This is provided via the `target-ros1-distro` or `target-ros2-distro` inputs.
Either or both may be specified, if neither is provided an error will be raised.
This input is used to `source setup.sh` for any installed ROS binary installations, as well as used as an argument to `rosdep install`.

## Action Output

This action defines [an output variable](https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#outputs) `ros-workspace-directory-name`.
It contains the path to the root of the ROS workspace assembled by the action.

The variable value should be used to retrieve logs, binaries, etc. after the action completes.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml) to get the list of flags supported by this action.

[action-ros-ci-template](https://github.com/ros-tooling/action-ros-ci-template) offers a template for using `action-ros-ci`.

### Build and run `ament_copyright` tests

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: ament_copyright
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
```

### Build with a custom `repos` or `rosinstall` file

You can specify your own repos file using the `vcs-repo-file-url` input.
You can also automatically generate your package's dependencies using the following workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  # Run the generator and output the results to a file.
  - run: |
      rosinstall_generator <package-name> --rosdistro <target-distro> \
      --deps-only --deps --upstream-development > /tmp/deps.repos
  # Pass the file to the action
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
      vcs-repo-file-url: /tmp/deps.repos
```

### Build a ROS 1 workspace

This tool supports building for both ROS and ROS 2 - to target ROS use `target-ros1-distro`

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
    with:
      required-ros-distributions: melodic
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros1-distro: melodic
      vcs-repo-file-url: ""
```

### Enable Address Sanitizer to automatically report memory issues

[ASan][addresssanitizer] is an open-source tool developed to automatically report
memory corruption bugs.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      colcon-mixin-name: asan
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/3e627e0fa30db85aea05a50e2c61a9832664d236/index.yaml
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
```

To look for detected memory errors, check the build logs for entries containing `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`. Example:

```
==9442== ERROR: AddressSanitizer heap-use-after-free on address 0x7f7ddab8c084 at pc 0x403c8c bp 0x7fff87fb82d0 sp 0x7fff87fb82c8
```

ASan is analyzing memory issues at runtime. ASan diagnostic messages will be emitted by the package tests when they run.

### Generate and process code coverage data

#### Generate code coverage information using `lcov` and `colcon-lcov-result`

If the compiler is invoked with the appropriate flags, `action-ros-ci` will use
[`colcon-lcov-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-lcov-result) to generate
coverage information.

Flags can be passed manually using, for instance, `extra-cmake-args`, but it is
preferable to use a `colcon` mixin to pass the appropriate flags automatically.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
      colcon-mixin-name: coverage-gcc
      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid
      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/5c45b95018788deff62202aaa831ad4c20ebe2c6/index.yaml
```

#### Generate code coverage information using `coveragepy` and `colcon-coveragepy-result`

If `colcon` is invoked with the `coverage-pytest` mixin, `action-ros-ci` will use
[`colcon-coveragepy-result`](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-coveragepy-result) to generate
coverage information.

Flags can be passed manually using, for instance, `extra-cmake-args`, but it is
preferable to use a `colcon` mixin to pass the appropriate flags automatically.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
      colcon-mixin-name: coverage-pytest
      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid
      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/5c45b95018788deff62202aaa831ad4c20ebe2c6/index.yaml
```

#### Integrate `action-ros-ci` with `codecov`

The generated code coverage information can be uploaded to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/).
In this case, you will need to setup a secret `CODECOV_TOKEN` in [your repository settings][creating-encrypted-secrets].

See [action/codecov-action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) documentation for more information about how to setup the action.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.1
  - uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
    with:
      package-name: my_package
      target-ros2-distro: foxy
      colcon-mixin-name: coverage-gcc
      # If possible, pin the repository in the workflow to a specific commit to avoid
      # changes in colcon-mixin-repository from breaking your tests.
      colcon-mixin-repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository/5c45b95018788deff62202aaa831ad4c20ebe2c6/index.yaml
  - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1.0.7
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      file: ros_ws/lcov/total_coverage.info
      flags: unittests
      name: codecov-umbrella
```

You will also need to add a `codecov.yaml` configuration file (at the root of your repo):

```yaml
fixes:
  - "ros_ws/src/my_package/::"
```

The configuration file is required to let codecov map the workspace directory structure, to the Git repository structure, and setup the links between codecov and GitHub properly.

### Store `colcon` logs as build artifacts

GitHub workflows can persist data generated in workers during the build using [artifacts](persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts). `action-ros-ci` generated colcon logs can be saved as follows:

```yaml
- uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
  id: action_ros_ci_step
  with:
    package-name: ament_copyright
    target-ros2-distro: foxy
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
  with:
    name: colcon-logs
    path: ${{ steps.action_ros_ci_step.outputs.ros-workspace-directory-name }}/log
- if: always() # upload the logs even when the build fails
```

### Use with a private repo

If using `action-ros-ci` with a private repo, it needs a personal access token to be able to checkout the code.
Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the "repo" scope and add it to your repo's [secrets][creating-encrypted-secrets].
For example, if your secret is called `REPO_TOKEN`:

```yaml
- uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.1
  with:
    package-name: my_package
    import-token: ${{ secrets.REPO_TOKEN }}
```

### Interdependent pull requests or merge requests

This action allows declaring PR dependencies.
For example, this may be useful when your PR depends on PRs/MRs/branches from other repos for it to work or be properly tested.

Include links to PR dependencies in your PR's description using the following format:

```
action-ros-ci-dependency: https://github.com/user/some-repo/pull/123
action-ros-ci-dependency: https://gitlab.com/user/some-repo/-/merge_requests/123
action-ros-ci-dependency: https://github.com/user/some-repo/tree/some-branch
action-ros-ci-dependency: https://gitlab.com/user/some-repo/-/tree/some-branch
```

If a given repo is in one of the repos files (see the [`vcs-repo-file-url` option](#Overview)), its `version` will be changed to point to the PR/MR/branch.
If a given repo is not in any of the repos files, it will be added to a new file and cloned along with the other repos.
This is useful if you usually rely on binary packages instead of building package dependencies from source every time.

Both GitHub and GitLab links are supported.
GitHub PRs are checked out using a `pull/$ID/merge` ref, i.e. PR source branch merged into target branch.
GitLab MRs are checked out using a `merge-requests/$ID` ref, i.e. MR source branch *not* merged into target branch, which is equivalent to using the MR's source branch directly.
