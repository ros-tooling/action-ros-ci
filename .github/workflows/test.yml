      # Greenkeeper provides automated dependency management
      # for this repository. It will automatically create
      # new branches with updated npm versions, and send
      # PRs for those automatically, if they build.
      # Greenkeeper relies on this CI to determine if a
      # PR needs to be open or not, and as such we need
      # to whitelist those branches for CI run here.
